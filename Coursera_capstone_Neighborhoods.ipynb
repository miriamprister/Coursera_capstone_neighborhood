    "Peer-graded Assignment: Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be required to explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. However, unlike New York, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet. What is interesting about the field of data science is that each project can be challenging in its unique way, so you need to learn to be agile and refine the skill to learn new libraries and tools quickly depending on the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. You will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is in a structured format, you can replicate the analysis that we did to the New York City dataset to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission will be a link to your Jupyter Notebook on your Github repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be required to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by creating a new Notebook for this assignment.\n",
    "Use the Notebook to build the code to scrape the following Wikipedia page, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M, in order to obtain the data that is in the table of postal codes and to transform the data into a pandas dataframe\n"
